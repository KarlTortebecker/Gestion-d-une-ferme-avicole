The Poultry Farm Management System is an online system that helps farmers to manage all activities carried out on a poultry farm, including the sale of chickens, trucking, and seeing what is happening in the farms without having to visit them. Farm managers and owners can use this system to view information about their poultry farms, such as sales data, invoices, and more. This helps them to make more informed decisions about the management of their farms and it also helps them to improve their farms.
